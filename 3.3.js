/*Write a program that will create a duplicate of a given array.

Bonus: make a first version that will only do it using push(). Make a second version that uses a single method call to perform the copy. (You'll have to search on MDN or Google for this one.) */

/* ----------------simple way ------------------ */

/*let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];

let copynumbers = [...numbers];

console.log(copynumbers);*/
